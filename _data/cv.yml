    - title: PhD, expected
      institution: University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada
      year: 2022
      description:
        - "I worked on solving stochastic models of population dynamics analytically and investigated the use of various approximations
          for analytically intractable models, to ascertain in which biological regimes certain models are valid."
        - I investigated mechanisms of receptor signaling that maximize accuracy estimation of external product concentration by the cell.
        - "In a collaboration, I built simulations of nanoparticles in the tumor microenvironment to determine the dynamics of these
          particles in cancerous tissue and investigating various pathways of nanoparticle absorption by tumors."
    - title: MSc
      institution: McGill University, Montr√©al, Canada
      year: 2017
      description:
        - Advanced computational tools to predict the evolutionary path of the genetic network between various species of the Dipteran family.
        - Developed a mathematical framework of the genetic network of drosophila during embryogenesis and fit these models to experimental data.
