    - title: PhD
      institution: University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada
      year: 2023
      description:
        - I worked on solving stochastic models of population dynamics analytically and investigated the use of various approximations
          for analytically intractable models, to ascertain in which biological regimes certain models are valid.
        - I investigated mechanisms of receptor signaling that maximize accuracy estimation of external product concentration by the cell.
        - In a collaboration, I built simulations of nanoparticles in the tumor microenvironment to determine the dynamics of these
          particles in cancerous tissue and investigating various pathways of nanoparticle absorption by tumors.
