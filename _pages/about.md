Welcome to my own little nook on the internet. 
As a recent PhD graduate in Physics, I'm excited to be taking a dive into new personal projects and professional experiences beyond academia.
This website chronicles my scientific and creative journey up to this point in time, I invite you to explore the many things I have proudly created and the collaborative efforts I've been lucky to be involved in.

My research journey has been marked by a deep fascination with understanding the intricate mechanisms that govern how interacting communities of physical, biological or financial entities form and develop.
Beyond this academic work, I've been privileged to work on a diverse set of projects that incorporated my quantiative experience with my passions.
Over the past 5 years, I have been fostering a student community whose mission is self-learning of principles in data science, participating in many of these hands-on projects in collaboration with peers.
From analyzing complex systems at the interface of physics and biology to generating lyrics to fictitious Lil Pump songs, I've found meaning and pleasure in delving into complex models to create  and gain insights into data.

Driven to use my expertise in a meaningful way, my focus is shifting towards harnessing the power of data science for social good.
Recognizing the immense potential that lies within data-driven approaches, I hope to use my knowledge to tackle complex social issues such as wealth disparities and environmental sustainability. 
I firmly believe that by analyzing and interpreting data through a social lens, we can foster evidence-based decision-making that drives tangible solutions addressing pressing social and environmental challenges.
